    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",

    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "The pipeline accepts two parameters: the imput image and a drawing function. In this notebook there are two drawing functions. One is the provided one used to drow raw hough lines and the other one coalled `draw_smooth_lines`. As the name implies it represent an attempt to improve the quality of the video overlay. The function separates the left and right lane lines based on the slope sign, than usess numpy.polyfit() function to fit a line on all end points. For reducing the video jitter it uses a simple sliding window averaging across the last `FRAMES` number of video frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The things I would like to improve:\n",
    "- Better extrapolation of line length.\n",
    "- Adaptive region clipping. It could be build dynamicaly based on distribution of the lines in the recent frames.\n",
    "- The stright line extrapolation will obviusly fail on a sharp curve. We need a higher order polynom for better fitting of lanes.\n",
    "- My current implamentaion filters out hough lines that exceed a hardcoded minimum and maximum slopes wich is another possible reason for failure.\n",
    "- My algorithm fails miserably on the challenge video. In addition to the problems I mention above this video contains very high contrast shadows and bright areas. The borders between these areas are detected as edges over the road serface. For this kind of images we need to use some shadows removal/softening transformations before feeding it to our pipeline.\n",
